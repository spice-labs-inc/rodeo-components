# Rodeo Components

This project defines both the component model interfacing and the exposed APIs for [goat rodeo](https://github.com/spice-labs-inc/goatrodeo).

Looking to get started? There are [docs](doc/), but you might want to start with [component-life](doc/component-life.md) which discusses how components are loaded and called from Goat Rodeo. There is also an [intoductory document](doc/intro.md) which describes coding style and
design decisions.

## Releases
